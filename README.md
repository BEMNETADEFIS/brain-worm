## Who

The team is formed from people coming from significatly different areas of arts, engineering, and psychology:

* **Krystof Kaplan** is an artist and author of kinetic sculpture dedicated and designed for BCI and neuro-feedback purposes
* **Vlastimil Koudelka** is an engineer and researcher in neuro-imaging, machine learning, and optimization

## What

###layer 1
The kinetic worm can move and breathe using its pneumatic mussels made of 24 tires. Extra eight tires are constantly inflated and form a sculpture skeleton. 

###layer 2
Solenoid valves are connected to a computer interface such that a synchronous patterns of movements can be created within [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/) environtment. The IDE can alse recieve UDP messages from realtime EEG analysis tools. OpenVibe and PureData are used and tested in our project.

###layer 3
OpenVibe is connected to NeuroSky Mindwave mobile device and further alyze the eeg stream to obtain a robust eeg marker. Relative frontal alpha power was chosen to measure a level of concentration.
